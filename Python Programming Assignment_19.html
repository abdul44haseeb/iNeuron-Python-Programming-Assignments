# Question2
# Create a function that reverses a boolean value and returns the string "boolean expected" if another variable type is given.
def reverse_boolean(value):
    if isinstance(value, bool):
        return not value
    else:
        return "boolean expected"
print(reverse_boolean(True))

#Question3
#Create a function that returns the thickness (in meters) of a piece of paper after folding it n number of times. The paper starts off with a thickness of 0.5mm.
def calculate_paper_thickness(number_of_folds):
    initial_thickness = 0.5  # Initial thickness in mm
    thickness = initial_thickness * (2 ** number_of_folds)
    thickness_meters = thickness / 1000  # Convert thickness to meters
    return thickness_meters

print(calculate_paper_thickness(0))  # No folds
print(calculate_paper_thickness(1))  # Folded once
print(calculate_paper_thickness(5))  # Folded five times
0.0005
0.001
0.016


# Question4
# Create a function that takes a single string as argument and returns an ordered list containing the indices of all capital letters in the string.
def find_capital_indices(string):
    capital_indices = []
    for index, char in enumerate(string):
        if char.isupper():
            capital_indices.append(index)
    return capital_indices

input_string = "Hello Everyone!. I will transition to be a Data Scientist from July 2023!!"
result = find_capital_indices(input_string)
print(result)
[0, 6, 17, 43, 48, 63]


# Question5
# Using list comprehensions, create a function that finds all even numbers from 1 to the given number.
def find_even_numbers(n):
    even_numbers = [x for x in range(1, n+1) if x % 2 == 0] #creates a new list by iterating over the range from 1 to n+1. The variable x represents each number in this range.
    return even_numbers # 

result = find_even_numbers(12)
print(result)
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

Variable names have certain rules and conventions that determine their validity. Here's why eggs is a valid variable name while 100 is invalid:

Valid variable names:

Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
Can contain letters, digits (0-9), and underscores.
Cannot be a reserved keyword or built-in identifier.
Since eggs starts with a letter and consists of only letters, it adheres to the rules and is considered a valid variable name in Python.

Invalid variable names:

Cannot start with a digit (0-9).
May not contain spaces or special characters (except underscore).
Should not be a reserved keyword or built-in identifier.
The name 100 starts with a digit, violating the rule that variable names cannot start with a digit. Therefore, 100 is not a valid variable name in Python.

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?

Answer:

int()
float()
str()


10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos.'

Answer:


The expression 'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos.' causes an error because you are trying to concatenate a string ('I have eaten' and 'burritos.') with an integer (99) using the + operator. In Python, the + operator is used for concatenating strings or performing addition with numeric values, but it does not automatically convert between different data types.

To fix this error, you need to ensure that all the operands are of the same data type. One way to do this is by converting the integer 99 into a string using the str() function. Here's the corrected expression:

'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'

    'I have eaten 99 burritos.'
