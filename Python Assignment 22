1. What is the result of the code, and explain?

 X = 'iNeuron'
 def func():
 print(X)

 func()

In the first line, the variable X is assigned the string value 'iNeuron'.
Then, a function named func is defined. Inside the function, print(X) is called, which prints the value of the variable X.
Finally, the func() is called, which executes the function and prints the value of X, which is 'iNeuron'.
So, when the code is executed, it will output 'iNeuron' as the value of X is accessible within the function func.


2. What is the result of the code, and explain?

X = 'iNeuron'
def func():
    X = 'NI!'

func()
print(X)



In the code, the variable X is initially assigned the string value 'iNeuron'.
Then, a function named func is defined. Inside the function, a local variable X is assigned the string value 'NI!'.
The func() function is called.
Finally, outside the function, print(X) is called, which prints the value of the global variable X, which is still 'iNeuron'.



3. What does this code print, and why?

'iNeuron'
def func():
 X = 'NI'
print(X)

func()
print(X)

Solution: 
NameError: name 'X' is not defined

The code tries to print the value of the variable X inside the function func() using the print(X) statement.
However, the variable X is not defined within the function. It is only defined as a string 'iNeuron' outside the function, which creates a global variable.
Since the variable X is not defined within the scope of the function, when the print(X) statement is executed, it raises a NameError stating that the name 'X' is not defined.
Therefore, the code throws an error and does not print any value.



4. What output does this code produce? Why?

X = 'Neuron'
def func():
 global X
X = 'NI'

func()
print(X)


The output of the code will be: NI

The code defines a variable X with the initial value 'Neuron' outside the function.
Inside the function func(), the global keyword is used to indicate that the variable X being referenced is the global variable defined outside the function.
The statement X = 'NI' inside the function assigns the value 'NI' to the global variable X.
When the function func() is called, it modifies the global variable X to have the value 'NI'.
After the function call, when print(X) is executed, it prints the current value of the global variable X, which is 'NI'.
Therefore, the output of the code is 'NI'.



5. What about this code—what’s the output, and why?

X = 'iNeuron'
def func():
 X = &#39;NI&#39;
def nested():
 print(X)
nested()

func()
X

The output of the code will be: iNeuron

The code defines a variable X with the initial value 'iNeuron' outside the functions.
The function func() is defined, but it only defines a local variable X with the value 'NI'. This variable is not used or accessed.
The function nested() is defined and it prints the value of the variable X.
Inside the nested() function, when print(X) is executed, it prints the value of the global variable X, which is 'iNeuron'.
The function nested() is then called, which prints 'iNeuron'.
After that, the function func() is called, but it does not affect the value of the global variable X.
Finally, when print(X) is executed, it prints the value of the global variable X, which is still 'iNeuron'.
Therefore, the output of the code is 'iNeuron'.



6. How about this code: what is its output in Python 3, and explain?

def func():
    X = 'NI'
    def nested():
        nonlocal X
        X = 'Spam'
    nested()
    print(X)

func()


The output of this code will be: Spam

The func() function defines a local variable X with the value 'NI'.
The nested() function is defined within func() and uses the nonlocal keyword to indicate that X refers to the variable in the enclosing scope (func()).
Inside nested(), the value of X is changed to 'Spam'.
Finally, when func() is called, it executes the nested() function, which modifies the value of X to 'Spam'.
The print(X) statement within func() then prints the value of X, which is 'Spam'.
