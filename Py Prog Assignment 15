Question 1:
Please write a program using generator to print the numbers which can be divisible by 5 and
7 between 0 and n in comma separated form while n is input by console.
Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:
100
Then, the output of the program should be:
0,35,70

Solution: 
def divisible_by_5_and_7(n):
    for i in range(n+1):
        if i % 5 == 0 and i % 7 == 0:
            yield i

# Get input from the user
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Generate and print the comma-separated numbers
numbers = divisible_by_5_and_7(n)
output = ",".join(map(str, numbers))
print(output)

Sample Output:
Enter a number: 100
0,35,70



Question 2:
Please write a program using generator to print the even numbers between 0 and n in comma
separated form while n is input by console.
Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:
10
Then, the output of the program should be:
0,2,4,6,8,10

Solution:
def even_numbers(n):
    for i in range(n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            yield i

# Get input from the user
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Generate and print the comma-separated even numbers
numbers = even_numbers(n)
output = ",".join(map(str, numbers))
print(output)


Sample Output:
Enter a number: 10
0,2,4,6,8,10



Question 3:
The Fibonacci Sequence is computed based on the following formula:
f(n)=0 if n=0
f(n)=1 if n=1
f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) if n&gt;1
Please write a program using list comprehension to print the Fibonacci Sequence in comma
separated form with a given n input by console.
Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:
7

Then, the output of the program should be:
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13


Solution:
# Get input from the user
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Compute the Fibonacci sequence using list comprehension
fib_sequence = [0, 1] + [fib_sequence[i-1] + fib_sequence[i-2] for i in range(2, n+1)]

# Print the comma-separated Fibonacci sequence
output = ",".join(map(str, fib_sequence))
print(output)

Sample Output:
Enter a number: 7
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13



Question 4:
Assuming that we have some email addresses in the "username@companyname.com" format,
please write program to print the user name of a given email address. Both user names and
company names are composed of letters only.
Example:
If the following email address is given as input to the program:
john@google.com
Then, the output of the program should be:
john

Solution:
# Get input from the user
email = input("Enter an email address: ")

# Extract the username from the email address
username = email.split("@")[0]

# Print the username
print(username)

Sample Output:
Enter an email address: john@google.com
john



Question 5:
Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has an init function
which takes a length as argument. Both classes have a area function which can print the area
of the shape where Shape&#39;s area is 0 by default.

Solution:
class Shape:
    def __init__(self):
        self.area = 0
    
    def calculate_area(self):
        pass


class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self, length):
        super().__init__()
        self.length = length
    
    def calculate_area(self):
        self.area = self.length ** 2


# Create an instance of the Square class
square = Square(5)

# Calculate the area of the square
square.calculate_area()

# Print the area of the square
print("Area:", square.area)

Output:
Area: 25
