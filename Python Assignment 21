1. Add the current date to the text file today.txt as a string.

from datetime import date

# Get the current date
current_date = date.today()

# Convert the date to a string
date_string = current_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

# Write the date string to the file
with open("today.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write(date_string)


2. Read the text file today.txt into the string today_string

from datetime import date

# Get the current date
current_date = date.today()

# Convert the date to a string
date_string = current_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

# Write the date string to the file
with open("today.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write(date_string)

# Read the contents of the file into a string
with open("today.txt", "r") as file:
    today_string = file.read()

# Print the string
print(today_string)



3. Parse the date from today_string.

from datetime import date

# Get the current date
current_date = date.today()

# Convert the date to a string
date_string = current_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

# Write the date string to the file
with open("today.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write(date_string)

# Read the contents of the file into a string
with open("today.txt", "r") as file:
    today_string = file.read()

# Print the string
print(today_string)

from datetime import datetime

# Parse the date from the string
parsed_date = datetime.strptime(today_string, "%Y-%m-%d")

# Print the parsed date
print(parsed_date)

Output : 2023-06-22 00:00:00



4. List the files in your current directory
import os

# Get the list of files in the current directory
files = os.listdir()

# Print the list of files
for file in files:
    print(file)



5. Create a list of all of the files in your parent directory (minimum five files should be available).

import os

# Get the path of the parent directory
parent_directory = os.path.abspath('..')

# Get the list of files in the parent directory
files = os.listdir(parent_directory)

# Print the list of files
for file in files:
    print(file)



6. Use multiprocessing to create three separate processes. Make each one wait a random number of
seconds between one and five, print the current time, and then exit.

import multiprocessing
import time
import random
from datetime import datetime

def process_function():
    wait_time = random.randint(1, 5)  # Generate a random wait time between 1 and 5 seconds
    time.sleep(wait_time)  # Sleep for the wait time
    current_time = datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S")  # Get the current time
    print("Current time:", current_time)  # Print the current time

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Create three separate processes
    processes = []
    for _ in range(3):
        p = multiprocessing.Process(target=process_function)
        processes.append(p)
        p.start()

    # Wait for all processes to finish
    for p in processes:
        p.join()

7. Create a date object of your day of birth.

from datetime import date

# Replace the values with your own day of birth
year = 1990
month = 5
day = 15

# Create a date object for your day of birth
birth_date = date(year, month, day)

print(birth_date)

Output:
PS C:\Users\Abdul Haseeb A\Documents\Python Assignment 17> & "C:/Program Files/Python311/python.exe" "c:/Users/Abdul Haseeb A/Documents/Python Assignment 17/zoo.py"
1990-05-15


8. What day of the week was your day of birth?

from datetime import date

# Replace the values with your own day of birth
year = 1990
month = 5
day = 15

# Create a date object for your day of birth
birth_date = date(year, month, day)

print(birth_date)

from datetime import date

# Assuming you have already created the birth_date object from the previous question
day_of_week = birth_date.strftime('%A')

print(day_of_week)

Output : 

PS C:\Users\Abdul Haseeb A\Documents\Python Assignment 17> & "C:/Program Files/Python311/python.exe" "c:/Users/Abdul Haseeb A/Documents/Python Assignment 17/zoo.py"
1990-05-15
Tuesday


9. When will you be (or when were you) 10,000 days old?

from datetime import date

# Replace the values with your own day of birth
year = 1990
month = 5
day = 15

# Create a date object for your day of birth
birth_date = date(year, month, day)

print(birth_date)

from datetime import date

# Assuming you have already created the birth_date object from the previous question
day_of_week = birth_date.strftime('%A')

print(day_of_week)

from datetime import date, timedelta

# Assuming you have already created the birth_date object from the previous question
days_to_add = timedelta(days=10000)
target_date = birth_date + days_to_add

print(target_date)


Output:

PS C:\Users\Abdul Haseeb A\Documents\Python Assignment 17> & "C:/Program Files/Python311/python.exe" "c:/Users/Abdul Haseeb A/Documents/Python Assignment 17/zoo.py"
